# DDC_machine_learning
##### Several example of manually creating Machine Learning.

This is for learning/tutorials, the models wont be as efficient as numpy, sklearn etc.  
I am completing a Masters in AI, and I will right the algorithims as I learn them.  
The plan is to build the models without importing many packages.  
(Current exceptions are numpy.log, numpy.inverse_matrix etc)
    
#### Notes  
* I will add more machine learning algorithims as I proceed
* Next step is creating a Perceptron Model

###### The current models:
* Matrix Class
* Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
* NaiveBayes (for text)
* Gaussian NaiveBayes (coming soon)
* Gradient Descent (for polynomials)
